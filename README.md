Course Material for DSCI1000: How Data Shape our World

This contains the lecture notes and slides that were created for DSCI1000: How Data Shape our World - a course I co-taught in Fall and Spring 2021 at Vanderbilt University with Will Doyle.  

The target audience is someone who is interested in Data Science, but who has no prior experience.  The class was designed to be application-forward -- demonstrating what you can do with the tools of data science in the hopes of motivating and encouraging students to go deeper and further. As an introductory class with no prerequisites, the statistical and programming fundamentals behind what we did is only briefly mentioned; the goal is to provide a sense of what can be done with data science rather than to provide a comprehensive foundation on a smaller set of topics.  The contents of this repository represent a work-in-progress and revisions and edits are likely frequent.

The course is motivated around several topics.

0) Introduction to R and Data Wrangling
1) Univariate Description and Visualization
2) Conditional Variation using Conditional Means
3) Conditional Variation using linear regression
4) Clustering
5) Classification using binary outcomes and logistic regressions  

Reactions and comments are welcome and apologies in advance for typos, errors, and inefficiencies, but you get what you pay for ;)

I have not yet added appropriate citations to existing work in the relevant areas, nor have I motivated each section sufficiently with a motivating puzzle.
