Course Material for DSCI1000: How Data Shape our World

This contains the lecture notes and slides that were created for DSCI1000: How Data Shape our World - taught in Fall 2021 at Vanderbilt University.  

The target audience is someone who is interested in Data Science, but who has no prior experience.  Examples are largely, but not exclusively, drawn from questions concerning contemporary politics and elections.

The contents of this repository represent a work-in-progress and revisions and edits are likely frequent.  

Reactions and comments are welcome and apologies in advance for typos, errors, and inefficiencies, but you get what you pay for ;)

The data and Markdown files are not yet public, as they are still being edited and cleaned, but contact me if interested.

The notes are not yet sequenced into a single document -- or organized into an elegant webpage yet -- but the order should be: DataWrangling, NationalPopularVote, Resampling, PredictingElectoralCollege. That said, some resampling is done in NationalPopularVote.

Also note that I have not yet added appropriate citations to existing work in the relevant areas, nor have I motivated each section sufficiently with a motivating puzzle.
